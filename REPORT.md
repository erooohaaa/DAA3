## 2. Comparison Between Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms

### 2.1 Efficiency Analysis

**Execution Time Comparison:**
- **Graph 1**: Prim (0.35 ms) vs Kruskal (0.66 ms) - **Prim 1.9x faster**
- **Graph 2**: Prim (0.03 ms) vs Kruskal (0.02 ms) - **Kruskal 1.5x faster**

**Operation Count Comparison:**
- **Graph 1**: Prim (10 ops) vs Kruskal (27 ops) - **Prim 2.7x more efficient**
- **Graph 2**: Prim (6 ops) vs Kruskal (18 ops) - **Prim 3x more efficient**

### 2.2 Performance Characteristics

**Prim's Algorithm:**
- **Strengths**: Superior operation efficiency, better for dense graphs
- **Complexity**: O(E log V) with binary heap
- **Memory Usage**: O(V + E) for adjacency lists
- **Implementation**: More complex with priority queue management

**Kruskal's Algorithm:**
- **Strengths**: Simpler implementation, better for sparse graphs  
- **Complexity**: O(E log E) for edge sorting
- **Memory Usage**: O(E) for edge storage
- **Implementation**: Straightforward with union-find structure

### 2.3 Correctness Verification
Both algorithms produced identical total construction costs for each graph:
- Graph 1: 16 (verified)
- Graph 2: 6 (verified)

This confirms the mathematical correctness of both implementations.

## 3. Conclusions and Algorithm Preferences

### 3.1 Performance Conclusions

1. **Operational Efficiency**: Prim's algorithm consistently demonstrated superior operation count efficiency (2.7-3x better)

2. **Execution Time**: Performance is context-dependent:
   - Prim excels on larger, denser graphs
   - Kruskal performs well on smaller graphs

3. **Memory Considerations**: Kruskal has better memory characteristics for sparse graphs

### 3.2 Algorithm Selection Guidelines

**Choose Prim's Algorithm when:**
- Working with dense graphs (many edges relative to vertices)
- Operation efficiency is critical
- Consistent performance is required across varying graph sizes
- Urban transportation networks with high connectivity

**Choose Kruskal's Algorithm when:**
- Dealing with sparse graphs (few edges relative to vertices) 
- Implementation simplicity is prioritized
- Memory constraints are a concern
- Rural or suburban networks with limited connectivity

### 3.3 Practical Implications for City Planning

**For Municipal Transportation Departments:**

1. **High-Density Urban Areas**: Prim's algorithm provides better long-term performance and operational efficiency

2. **Mixed Urban-Rural Networks**: Consider implementing both algorithms and selecting based on district density

3. **Real-Time Planning Systems**: Prim's consistent operation count makes it more predictable for performance planning

4. **Resource-Constrained Environments**: Kruskal's lower memory footprint may be advantageous

## 4. Implementation Insights and Code Quality

### 4.1 Technical Implementation Assessment

**Strengths:**
